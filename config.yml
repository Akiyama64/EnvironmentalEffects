#EnvironmentalEffects configuration file

#Dont ever use tabs to format any Spigot config, it wont work, only use spaces!

#Each effect by this plugin can have as many instances as you want. Specific instances will be tied to specific areas and 
#can all be specified in the same config section. Each instance has it's own identifier, which is the name of the section 
#in the config. Try to avoid duplicating identifiers and NEVER use the same identifier twice for the same effect.
#An example:

#effectXYZ:
#   firstInstance:
#       .details
#       .about
#       .firstInstance
#   secondInstance:
#       .details
#       .about
#       .secondInstance

#       etc.

#Some effects also require identifier within identifiers (there will be more information if thats the case), 
#the same rules apply for those.

#Some config values will require you to specify an amount of time or a timespan. This plugin supports multiple
#formats for time, you can add a letter at the end of a number to describe in which unit it is. Valid identifers are:
#h (hours), m (minutes), s (second) and t (ticks). If no identifier is given, the value will be interpreted as tick. 
#It is also possible to combine those identifiers, but the numbers must always be integers, here are some examples:

#10 minutes:
#time: 10m

#20 ticks:
#time: 20t
#or
#time: 1s
#or
#time: 20
#All of those mean exactly the same

#1 hour 2 minutes and 10 seconds
#time:1h10s2m
#The order doesn't matter, you could even do this:
#time:1m1h10s1m
#And you would get the same result


#Every effect by this plugin will be active in specific areas and require you to specify the areas for the effect. 
#Effects without areas won't do anything and might as well be removed from the config, because they are just eating 
#up unused computing power. Possible areas are: BIOME, CIRCLE, RECTANGLE and GLOBAL, all effects are active from bedrock 
#to skylimit and areas for a single effect can be combined as much as wanted.

#BIOMES means the effect is active in a specific biome (or multiple). Use the spigot identifier for biomes to 
#describe them, a full list of those can be found at https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html

#CIRCLE will require you to specify a variable called xsize, which will be the radius of the circle and a location, 
#which will be the center of the circle. Effects will be applied to every player inside the circle. The central location 
#will require you to specify an x and z coordinate, specifying a y-level is possible, but doesn't have any effects currently, 
#if it's not specified the y-level will default to 0

#RECTANGLE will require you to specify a xsize, a zsize and a center location. The xsize and zsize describe the size of the
#rectangle, starting at the central location, which means the final rectangle will have a total size of (2*xSize)*(2*zSize), 
#centred on the given location. For specifying the central location the same rules apply as for a CIRCLE

#GLOBAL simply means the effect will be applied to every player on the map, dont combine global with any other area descriptions,
#it will lead to exception. To use global, simply put "GLOBAL" into the biomes list.

#Here are some examples for valid area configurations:

#A global effect:

#areas:
#   biomes:
#    - GLOBAL

#An effect which is applied in plains and beach biomes:

#areas:
#   biomes:
#    - BEACH
#    - PLAINS

#An effect which is applied in a 30 radius circle around 1000,1000:

#areas:
#   locations:
#       exampleName1:
#           shape: CIRCLE
#           xsize: 30
#           center:
#               x: 1000
#               z: 1000

#More advanced combination:

#areas:
#   biomes:
#    - MEGA_TAIGA
#    - ROOFED_FOREST
#   locations:
#       exampleName2:
#           shape: RECTANGLE
#           xsize: 45
#           zsize: 50
#           center:
#               x: -3000
#               z: 2000
#       exampleName3:
#           shape: CIRCLE
#           xsize: 100
#           center:
#               x: 1337
#               z: 1337
    

#Some effects also allow you to specify specific environmental conditions for the player, which have to be fulfilled so the
#effect is applied. Only some allow this and if it is allowed the example next to the config section will show it. An example:

#player_environment_state:
#   rain: true
#   night: true

#This for example will lead to effects only being applied if it's raining and it's night for the player. Night is here defined
#as >12000 dayticks. If you wanted the effect for example to only be active during the day, night would have to be set to true.
#If you want to ignore one of the options, for example to always apply an effect when it's raining, independent from the day
#time, simply leave the time option out like this:

#player_environment_state:
#   rain: true
    
#This works with both options


#Some effects might require you to also specify itemstacks. Each itemstack has it's own identifier in this config and an example 
#itemstack section could look like this:

#                   ExampleDrop54:
#                       material: CLOCK
#                       amount: 2
#                       display_name: The Clockback
#                       lore: Special admin crime tool
#                       enchants:
#                           KB5:
#                               enchant: KNOCKBACK
#                               level: 20                   

#Each item requires you to specify the material, use the spigot identifiers for those, a full list can be found here: 
#https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
#amount is the amount of the item, if it is not specified it will default to 1.
#display_name is the name of the item, if it's not specified the item wont be named
#lore is the lore of the item, it's also optional and will be just empty if it's not set
#enchants lists all enchants that should be on the item. Each enchant has it's own config identifier and needs 2 options 
#to be specified, enchant is the spigot identifier for the enchant, #a list of those can be found here: 
#https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html
#level is simply the level of the enchant. You can specify as many enchants as
#you want or completly remove the whole enchants section, it's optional.

#Now the actual config with explainations alongside the different effects and options:
    
    
#How often players are updated whether it's raining or not. This is only needed when players are 
#walking into regions with different weather than their previous region, higher values here mean 
#it might take longer until the players weather is updated. Defaults to 200 ticks if not set.
rainupdate: 200

#How often the daytime for players is updated. If time is slowed down or stopped completly, this 
#shouldn't be too high, because otherwise players will notice the sudden change. Defaults to 200
#ticks if not set
timeupdate: 200

#Keeps fireballs from dealing terrain damage if set to true. This might be needed if the fireballl rain is heavily used
#to prevent the whole world being destroyed slowly. But then again this makes the effect very boring, because it makes it 
#almost invisble
disable_fireball_terraindamage: true

#Keeps fireballs from igniting terrain if set to true
disable_fireball_terrainignition: true

#Completly disables passive fire spread if set to true. Player can still ignite individual blocks if this is enabled
firespread_disabled: true

#Name of the main world this is supposed to work on. This plugin only supports a single world per server yet,
#mob spawning and possibly some other features won't work in worlds other than the main world set here
worldname: world

#Weather machines can modify the weather for players completly. Other than in vanilla, different regions can have
#different weather thanks to this plugin, because the weather is only changed in the players client and not
#actually serverside

#Example config for weather machines:
#weathermachines:
#   permarain:
#       rain_chance: 1.0
#       minimum_rain_duration: 400
#       areas:
#           biomes:
#            - OCEAN

#Every minimum_rain_duration, the server decides based on the chance specified at rain_chance, whether it will rain
#for the next minimum_rain_duration. A rain chance of 1.0 means it will always rain, 0.5 means a 50 % chance and 0.0 means
#it will never rain etc., any double value can be used here.

weathermachines:


#Daytime modifiers can speed up, slow down or completly stop the minecraft ingame days. Different daytimes in different regions
#on the same server are possible with this. It is also possible to only speed up days or nights.

#Example config for a daytime_modifier:
#daytime_modifier:
#   long_nights:
#       starting_time: 20000
#       dayspeed: 1.0
#       nightspeed: 0.5
#       areas:
#           biomes:
#            - GLOBAL

#The starting time is the set time whenever the server is started or the plugin is reloaded. A detailied explaination 
#of ingame time can be found here: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Day-night_cycle#Conversions

#dayspeed is a multiplier of the vanilla dayspeed. 0.0 would mean that time doesn't change at all, 1.0 would result in 
#vanilla 20min days and for example 0.0138888 would make an ingame day last 24 real hours. 

#nightspeed is the multipler for ingame nights. This can be set to a different value than the one for days and can also
#get removed completly, if it's not set the same value as for days will be used for nights

#Values higher than 1.0 are possible to speed up the days, but too high values might lead to very weird behavior.

daytime_modifier:


#lightning effects allow you to create as much lightning around players as you want. An example config:

#lightning:
#   endoftheworld:
#       areas:
#           biomes:
#            - GLOBAL
#       frequency: 15s
#       player_environment_state:
#           rain: true
#       deal_damage: false
#       range: 16

#frequency simply is how often lighting strikes near each player

#deal_damage specifies whether the lightning should deal damage to players, if this is set to true it will deal
#damage and might kill player. Defaults to true if not set

#range is the range around the player in which the lightning can randomly strike. Calculation of the area is the same square
#calculation as for all other effects. Defaults to 32 if not set.

lightning:

#non-functional yet
#effects:
#   snowstorm:
#       effect_type: SNOW_SHOVEL
#       speed: 1.0
#       amount: 40
#       delay: 20


#This effect spawns fireballs at y=255 around players. Be careful when using this without disabling fireball terrain 
#distruction and fire generation, the fireballs will
#slowly destroy the whole surrounding and set everything on fire

#Example config:
#fireball:
#    netherFireRain:
#       frequency: 10s
#       range: 20
#       areas:
#           biomes:
#            - HELL
#       player_environment_state:
#           night: false

#frequency influences how often fireballs are spawned around the player. If frequency is set too low (<20ticks) it might 
#heavily influence server performance. The fireballs will spawn in a random location in a square, which's sides are 2*range
#long and which is centred on the player. If range it set to 0, all fireballs will be spawned right above the player.

fireball:

#Potion effects allow to give out specific buffs and debuffs in specific regions to players (other entities wont be affected)
#Example config:

#potion_effects:
#   funareajump:
#       type: JUMP
#       duration: 60s
#       level: 2
#       areas:
#          locations:
#            funarea1:
#               shape: CIRCLE
#               xsize: 200
#               center:
#                    x: 0
#                    z: 0 
#       player_environment_state:
#           night: true                

#type describes which type of potion effect is applied, use the spigot identifier for those, a full list can be found here: 
#https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html
#duration is simply the amount of time the buff lasts, it will be refreshed every duration*0.75 and level is the level 
#of the potion effect. A detailed explaination what different levels of potion effects do can be found here:
#http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Status_effect#List_of_effects 

potion_effects:

#Armour based damage allows you to deal damage to player because they are wearing a specific piece of armour or because they
#are not wearing a specific piece of armour. An example config could look like this:

#armour_based_damage:
#   deserts_are_hot:
#       areas:
#           biomes:
#            - DESERT
#       frequency: 5m
#       damage_message: The sand is burning your feet!
#       damage_amount: 1
#       player_environment_state:
#           night: false
#       armour:
#           boots: 
#            - NONE
#            - IRON
#            - CHAINMAIL

#damage_message is a message that is sent to a player whenever damage is dealt to him, if this option is not set, no message
#will be sent

#damage_amount is the damage dealt to the player, where 1 is half a heart. Counting like this, a player has 20 health maximum

#armour allows you to specify with which armour a player should be damaged. Possible subsections here are helmet, chest, leggings
#and boots, you can provide a list with damage cases for each of those. If a list is left empty or the slot isn't even listed,
#the plugin will assume that the slot doesn't matter for this effect. The arguments put into the list of each slot decide with
#which armour type specifically damage should be dealt, possible identifers here are DIAMOND, GOLD, IRON, CHAINMAIL, LEATHER,
#NONE and ANY. Specific armour types mean the player will receive damage if his armour is of the given type, NONE means damage 
#will be dealt if the player is wearing no armour at all and ANY means the player will be damaged if he is wearing any armour
#in that slot at all. If only one of the arguments is full filled, the damage will still be dealt, this applies both for 
#different slots and different armourtypes in the list for each slot. Try to avoid overlapping arguments, for example if you
#specify ANY, you wont need to list any other type.


armour_based_damage:


#The monster spawning part of this plugin is very powerful and allows you to spawn completly customized mobs around players.

#First of all, just for like every other effect, you can have as many instances of this active as you want. 
#The update time decides how often the plugins attempts to spawn mobs next to every player, this is the same 
#for all mobs spawned by this instance. Each instance also has as many mobconfigs as wanted (at least 1),
#those have their own identifers and completly describe the monster which should be spawned.

#In a mobconfig, type describes which type of monster should be spawned. Use entity identifiers for that, 
#a full list can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
#Just because stuff like carts are entities doesn't mean you can spawn them with this, only use this config 
#part to spawn monsters. anything else will lead to exceptions etc.

#name is the name the mob will be given after spawning, this is optional and if you either leave the field 
#empty or completly remove the option, the mob will be spawned without a name.

#range defines the maximum distance from a player a mob could spawn, like for other effects, this defines a square,
#which's sides are 2*range long and which is centred on the player, the spawning location is randomized inside this
#square and on the same y-level as the player. If the option range is not set, it will default to 32

#amount specifies how many monsters with the given specifics should be spawned at once, for example in 
#the example config above, 2 spooky skeletons would be spawned at once. If this option is removed, it defaults to 10

#maximum_spawn_attempts defines how often the plugin should try to find a suitable spawning location for the monsters.
#It wont spawn them inside of walls etc. and instead try to find a free space inside the given range and give up after 
#maximum_spawn_attempts. If this option is removed, it defaults to 5

#deathmessage is the message that is sent to the player who kills the monster. If this option is removed or left empty, 
#no message will be sent.

#spawn_chance is the chance to even spawn something every updatetime. This is a double, where 1.0 means it should always
#try to spawn and 0.0 means it should never try to spawn. This chance does not take into account that there might be no 
#location for the monster to spawn in and that the spawning could fail because of that.

#drops is a list of items, which are dropped by the monster upon death. This part is also optional, if it doesnt exist 
#the drops will be vanilla. A monster spawned by this plugin will only drop it's "special" drops as defined in this 
#config if it was killed by a player, otherwise the drops will be vanilla. Also a monster will never drop the armour
#or weapon it was given when it spawned

#equipment is the equipment of the monster. You dont need to specify in which slot something will be equipped, that will 
#be detected automatically, but just use common sense and for example dont try to equip a chestplate on a spider, it wont 
#work and might crash. Specifying equipment is optional

#buffs is a list of buffs that will be applied to the monster, they will last forever (technically not, but no player will 
#ever see a buff end). Just specify the type and level for each buff, same as for the potion effect section applies here. 
#Specifying buffs is also optional.

#on_hit_debuffs allows to let monster apply specific debuffs (or even buffs) to players hit by them. Each debuff requires you
#to specify a type (same thing as for potion buffs), it's level, the duration, the level and a chance to apply it upon hitting 
#a player. If the duration is not set, it will default to 5 seconds and if the chance is not set, it will default to 1.0. 
#Chance is a double, where 1.0 is 100 % and 0.0 is 0%

#General advice on the balancing of mobs: If you want to spawn monster during the day, give them fire res. Skeletons wont spawn
#with a bow unless you give them one and strength does not apply to arrows, work with power enchants on the bow instead. Also
#giving monsters utility instead of flat out damage is usually better.

#spawn specifies which type of mob should be replace if it spawns from spawners, use spigot identifiers here. A full list
#of those can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html

#mobconfig simply asks you to specify a mob config the same way it needs to be done for the random based mob spawning,
#look there for detailed explaination of the specific options

spawner:


#title allows you to display players titles if they enter specific areas. Titles are always displayed
#when a player logs in or respawns and then in a given time intervall this effect will check if the player is
#in the area. A title will not be shown again to a player until he was located outside the area and then 
#enters the area again. An example config:

#title:
#   importantmessage:
#       title: list of nerds
#       subtitle: unitive
#       fadein: 1s
#       stay: 2s
#       fadeout: 1s
#       updatetime: 10s
#       areas:
#           biomes:
#            - PLAINS       

#title is the title of the message sent to the player

#subtitle is the subtitle of the title sent to the player 

#fadein is how long the title should take to fade in, stay is how long it stays on the screen and fadeout
#is how long it takes to fade out of the players screen

#updatetime is how often the effect checks whether the player is in the area currently and whether a message 
#should be sent

#The dispenser section allows you to buff dispensers to deal more damage and apply debuffs. An example config:

#dispenser:
#   example1:
#       areas:
#           biomes:
#            - EXTREME_HILLS
#       extradamage: 4
#       infinite_arrows: true
#       on_hit_debuffs:
#          theyseenothing:
#            type: BLINDNESS
#            level: 1
#            duration: 5s
#            chance: 0.2 

#extradamage is the amount of damage that is dealt additionally. One damage means half a heart here

#on_hit_debuffs simply allows you to specify debuffs, similar to other effects. Level will default to 1, if not specified,
#duration's default is 5 seconds and the chance defaults to 1.0 (100%)

#infinite_arrows adds an arrow to a dispenser whenever an arrow is fired, effectively keeping them filled forever,
#this option defaults to false. Use with caution this basically dupes arrows.

#Effects will only be applied if the dispenser is also in the specified area
